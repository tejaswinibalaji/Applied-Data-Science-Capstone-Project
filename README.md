# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
## Sentiment Analysis on the IMDB Movies Database ##
This capstone project is to understnad the various paradigm involved in Sentiment Analyiis of texts.
In a largely online world Sentiment analysis has become an important tool to understand the user/ buyers sentiment towards a movie /video / product .
In an attempt to learn this I am using the IMDB Movies review data. This project demonstrates about how to 
- Prepare Data for Sentiment Analysis
- Use basic techniques to builds a sentiment analyser  
- Evaluate the polarity of text as negative or positive

## Getting The Data ##

The dataset is compiled from a collection of 50,000 reviews from IMDB on the condition there are no more than 30 reviews per movie. The numbers of positive and negative reviews are equal. Negative reviews have scores less or equal than 4 out of 10 while a positive review have score greater or equal than 7 out of 10. Neutral reviews are not included. The 50,000 reviews are divided evenly into the training and test set.
